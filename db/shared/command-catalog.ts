Params: \`{ fileId, cellId, value, valueHtml?, laneId? }\` — batch many per changeset.
Compiles to \`target.cell.commit\` through the /events perimeter.
Gotchas:
- \`laneId\` must already be registered in the project's targetLanes (register via PatchSettings first); omit for the default lane.
- Duplicate (cell, lane) targets in one changeset dedupe with a warning — last wins.
- Committing resets the cell's validation state by design.
Example: \`{ "kind": "SetTranslation", "fileId": "f1", "cellId": "c3", "value": "En el principio…" }\``,

    paramsDoc: `### LinkMedia
Params: \`{ fileId, cellId, artifactId }\` — the artifact must be audio-kind, same project.
Compiles to \`cell.audio.attach\` + \`cell.audio.select\`; bytes are copied into the app's native audio layout so playback works everywhere.
Gotcha: upload the artifact first (REST artifact endpoint with \`x-artifact-kind: audio\`); LinkMedia-only changesets cannot mix other commands.`,

    paramsDoc: `### PlanImport
Params: \`{ fileName, fileType, artifactId?, manifest?, cells: [{ content, canonicalRef?, … }] }\`.
Sole command in its changeset; cap 5000 cells. Compiles to \`file.create\` + N \`source.cell.create\`.
Gotchas:
- Prefer parsing an uploaded artifact server-side (artifact parse endpoint / preview_import) and staging from its results, so the original is preserved for round-trip export.
- Cells may carry per-lane \`variants\` for multi-language imports.
- Duplicate file names are a staleness precondition — prepare warns, commit re-checks.`,

    agentReachable: true,
    paramsDoc: `### CreateProject
Params: \`{ name, projectId?, orgId? }\` — sole command; forced ask-mode regardless of credential mode.
Requires org MAINTAINER (600) on the target org; project-scoped credentials can never create projects.
Gotcha: when \`projectId\` is omitted the changeset URL's project id becomes the definitive id, pinned at prepare (crash-retry re-applies the same id).`,

    paramsDoc: `### PatchSettings
Params: \`{ projectId, ops: [{ key, value }], ifMatchVersion }\` — sole command; top-level settings keys only; each op replaces that key's value wholesale (one op per key — duplicates are rejected).
Floors: \`terminology\` needs the org's termbase-edit floor (default PROJECT_LEAD 500); every other key needs MAINTAINER 600.
Policy keys are NEVER writable by agents (permission_denied): agentMemoryAutonomy, validationRoleFloor, validationNamedUsers, validationCount, validationCountAudio, allowSelfValidation, harmonize_min_role, contributeToGlobalTm.
Gotchas:
- \`ifMatchVersion\` must equal the live settings version at prepare AND commit (plan_stale on drift) — read it first.
- Prefer this over UpdateProjectSettings (deprecated whole-blob replace).
Example: \`{ "kind": "PatchSettings", "projectId": "p1", "ops": [{ "key": "targetLanes", "value": ["es","pt"] }], "ifMatchVersion": 7 }\``,

    agentReachable: true,
    paramsDoc: `### EmitEvents
Params: \`{ events: [{ kind, fileId?, cellId?, laneId?, payload? }] }\` — sole command; max 200 events per changeset.
The generalized escape hatch: stages role-allowed event kinds through the same precondition doctrine as SetTranslation. The changeset floor is the max floor across events (per-kind floors come from role-policy).
Allowed kinds v1: comment.create/edit/delete/resolve · cell.waive/unwaive · cell.validate/unvalidate (testimony — reviewed per item, never bulk) · cell.backtranslation.set · target.cell.repin · file.rename/delete/restore · assignment.create/reassign/unassign.
Not here: target text (use SetTranslation), source edits, audio (use LinkMedia), imports (use PlanImport), reorders/retimes.
Gotchas:
- Head pins (editEventId / targetEventId / sourceEventId / expectedTargetEventId) are SERVER-RESOLVED from the live projection at prepare — omit them; a supplied value is rejected. Commit re-checks the pins (plan_stale on drift).
- Every referenced cell/comment/file/assignment must exist at prepare — one bad reference rejects the whole plan (no silent skips).
- payload shapes match the app's event vocabulary — call describe_command or docs before hand-building unfamiliar payloads.`,

    paramsDoc: `### RenameFile
Params: \`{ fileId, name }\` — batch several per changeset; cannot mix with other command kinds.
\`name\` is trimmed; 1–256 chars, matching the UI's rename field. Compiles to \`file.rename\` through the /events perimeter, at the same CONTRIBUTOR floor the UI rename uses.
Gotchas:
- Sugar over EmitEvents: the staged plan you read back holds the equivalent \`file.rename\` events, not a \`RenameFile\` entry. Behavior is identical either way.
- The file must exist and not be deleted at prepare, and is re-checked at commit (plan_stale on drift).
- File DELETE is deliberately not offered as its own command — soft-delete/trash semantics are still in flux (AQU-272).
Example: \`{ "kind": "RenameFile", "fileId": "f1", "name": "Mark (draft 2)" }\``,

    paramsDoc: `### RenameProject
Params: \`{ projectId, name }\` — sole command in its changeset; \`projectId\` must equal the changeset's project.
Receipt-only (a plain \`projects\` row write, not an event), gated at MAINTAINER 600 — the same floor as the UI's rename. Always staged in ask-mode regardless of credential mode, so it always needs human approval at the approvalUrl before commit.
\`name\` is trimmed; 1–256 chars. Renaming to the name the project already has is rejected at prepare (nothing to do), and, if a human gets there first, lands as \`superseded\` at commit.`,

Params: \`{ projectId }\` — sole command in its changeset; \`projectId\` must equal the changeset's project.
Receipt-only (stamps \`projects.archived_at\`), OWNER 700 only — the same floor as the UI's archive. Always staged in ask-mode regardless of credential mode: no agent archives a project unattended. Reversible with UnarchiveProject; project DELETE is never exposed to any agent surface.
Gotchas:
- Archiving an already-archived project is rejected at prepare, and lands as \`superseded\` at commit if a human archived it first.
- Once archived, ordinary project reads and writes stop resolving for everyone; only the lifecycle commands still reach the project.`,
