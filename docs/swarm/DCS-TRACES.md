# DCS Importer swarm — TRACES

Gaps, deferrals, open TODOs, and honest limitations discovered during the build. Append-only.
Next agent / next wake: pick up anything here.

- 2026-07-06 · start · Wave 1 (Slice A foundation) about to dispatch.
- Deferred by spec (§12), do NOT build in this swarm unless flagged: webhooks/background sync;
  `twl` join tables; `rc://` link-graph + tw/ta reader UI; USFM `\zaln` alignment; shared
  cross-org mirror org; server-side service-account adapter.
- OPEN: adapter-project dedupe within an org — v1 reuse by `(owner/repo)` match on `dcsUpstream`;
  confirm behavior when two users import the same repo.
- OPEN: markdown tw/ta cell-id stability (no ID column) — content-hash matching mitigates; may
  show spurious delete+create on structural reflow. Lowest priority (Slice E tail).
